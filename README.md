## Getting Started
### Install the dependencies

The codebase has libraries it depends on to run - these are refered to as "dependencies". You need to install these dependencies before you can run the codebase. To install the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```


### Run the development server

The codebase uses a development server to run the code. This is a server that runs on your local machine, and allows you to view the code in your browser. To run the development server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```
